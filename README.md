# mm-pos
mm-pos is an open-source Point of Sale system built to replace the outdated and expensive POS software many restaurants still use. It started as a project for my familyâ€™s restaurant and is meant to give any restaurant a modern, flexible, and affordable alternative for handling orders, payments, and receipts.
